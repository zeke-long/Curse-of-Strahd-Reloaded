*A continuation of the Kirryan Adventure*

The party comes out of the cave that has collapsed in on the [[Obsidian Heart]]. They go and find [[Silas]] a place to stay and presumably go and find his father (Ver), who is drunk at a brothel. 

### Deerick's Bar Confronting Ver

*The bar is filled with the haze of cheap perfume and the low murmur of laughter, and you see Ver lounged back in a plush chair, a half-empty bottle of expensive elven wine dangling carelessly from his hand. He looked nothing like the desperate father who had burst into Deerick's Bar just days ago and begged you to find his son —his eyes were glazed over, his face flushed, and his clothes far richer than the simple attire he had worn before.*
*Ver grinned sloppily, gold bracelets clinking as he waved at one of the women to bring him another drink. “Another round for everyone! On me!” he declared, raising his glass high. Several patrons cheered, toasting him with raised mugs. He leaned back, laughing loudly, spilling some of the wine as he turned to one of the girls at his side.*
*“Can you believe it?” he slurred, clutching a fistful of coins and letting them rain down onto the floor. “Who knew a nobody like me could get so lucky? Out of nowhere—poof! I’m rich!” His laugh was hollow and coarse, but his companions indulged him with polite smiles, eyes flicking between him and the growing pile of gold on the table.*
*He staggered to his feet, taking a drunken bow. “To me, Ver! The man of the hour, living the dream!” He raised his glass to the ceiling and drained it in a single gulp. Stumbling, he collapsed back into his chair with a heavy thud, oblivious to the scornful glances from some of the rougher-looking patrons around the room.*
*Ver was flaunting his wealth shamelessly, scattering coins and gems like candy as he bought rounds for the entire brothel. His eyes were dull with intoxication, but every so often, a flicker of something darker passed over his face. Perhaps a shadow of guilt, quickly drowned out by another swig of the rich wine.*

**If the players come up to him and talk to him about his son -** 
*“Silas... Silas who?” he muttered to himself, almost too low to hear, before shoving the thought away with a dismissive shake of his head. He laughed again, raising his voice to a shout. “Who cares! I’m rich now, and that’s all that matters!”*

Probably some murdering of Ver. 

### Funeral Arrangements

You step into a grand, cavernous chamber that feels more like a courtroom crossed with an opulent ballroom than a place for legal business. Rows upon rows of high-backed benches fan out in a half-circle, all filled with well-dressed people whispering and chattering, each craning their necks to catch a glimpse of you as you enter. A massive stained-glass window at the back of the room casts a kaleidoscope of colors across the space, painting everything in vivid hues of red, blue, and gold.

At the center of it all, a high, wooden dais looms over the assembly, draped in rich, royal purple cloths that flutter softly in the breeze coming through the open archways. Behind it sits the presiding figure of the day—a stern, almost caricatured judge dressed in somber black robes, his expression a mix of boredom and faint interest. This is no ordinary courtroom; it’s been transformed for a _celebration of life_—a theatrical send-off for a man who was clearly larger than life.

To your surprise, there’s even a small orchestra off to the side, providing soft, upbeat music that somehow manages to be both celebratory and respectful. Tall bouquets of vibrant flowers line the aisles, their scent mingling with the heady aroma of candles burning in elaborate brass candelabras. People murmur to each other as you and the rest of the party take your seat.

Among the gathered crowd, there are those who wear expressions of genuine grief, but just as many seem to be here out of obligation or even sheer curiosity. [[Derek]] - you catch a few familiar faces—wealthy merchants, city officials, and some of the shadier characters you’ve crossed paths with before—all paying their respects to the late Mister Aberford, the influential man whose death has brought you all here today. [[Valarie]] and [[Shalely]] you also see some professors that you recognize. There is no deceriable through-line between them. 

And, of course, there’s the star attraction of this grand affair: the immense mahogany desk set dead center on the dais, piled high with scrolls, documents, and what looks suspiciously like a small chest—probably filled with whatever wealth Mister Aberford left behind. It’s a bequeathment and a spectacle rolled into one, with every eye in the chamber fixed on that desk, waiting to see who will walk away with the spoils.

But your gaze is drawn to two other people seated near the front, standing out even amidst this sea of mourners and opportunists.

To the left of the dais, lounging casually in a chair that looks almost laughably too large for her, is a tall, striking woman dressed in rugged leathers. Her boots are stained with mud, and her gear is clearly meant for the wilderness, not the polished floors of a courthouse. A longbow leans beside her, looking dangerously out of place among the well-dressed crowd. Yet she seems completely at ease, one leg draped lazily over the armrest of her chair, her gaze sweeping the room with a look of relaxed amusement.

Across from her, a stark contrast, sits a crimson-skinned Tiefling woman, hunched forward as if the very air around her were suffocating. Her hands clutch at the edge of her seat, fingers twitching nervously against the wood. Every so often, her gaze flickers upward, scanning the crowd with a haunted intensity, but she quickly looks away whenever anyone meets her eyes. There’s a strange, raw tension about her—like she’s expecting to be called out at any moment and would crumble the second someone spoke her name.

The judge raps his gavel once, twice, drawing the room’s attention as he leans forward, peering over the stacks of paper with a stern look.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he announces, his voice booming in the chamber. “We are gathered here today to honor the memory of the esteemed Mister Aberford, a man of many talents and connections, and to address the matter of his last will and testament.” He gestures grandly toward the assembled guests, a smile creeping onto his lips as he pauses dramatically. “And to see who among you shall benefit from his considerable generosity.”

All eyes turn to the two figures beside the dais—the ranger lounging with a cat-like ease and the Tiefling rigid with nerves—before shifting back to you. It seems you’re not the only ones with a stake in today’s proceedings.
