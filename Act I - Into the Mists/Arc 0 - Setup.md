*A continuation of the Kirryan Adventure*

The party comes out of the cave that has collapsed in on the [[Obsidian Heart]]. They go and find [[Silas]] a place to stay and presumably go and find his father (Ver), who is drunk at a brothel. 

### Deerick's Bar Confronting Ver

*The bar is filled with the haze of cheap perfume and the low murmur of laughter, and you see Ver lounged back in a plush chair, a half-empty bottle of expensive elven wine dangling carelessly from his hand. He looked nothing like the desperate father who had burst into Deerick's Bar just days ago and begged you to find his son —his eyes were glazed over, his face flushed, and his clothes far richer than the simple attire he had worn before.*
*Ver grinned sloppily, gold bracelets clinking as he waved at one of the women to bring him another drink. “Another round for everyone! On me!” he declared, raising his glass high. Several patrons cheered, toasting him with raised mugs. He leaned back, laughing loudly, spilling some of the wine as he turned to one of the girls at his side.*
*“Can you believe it?” he slurred, clutching a fistful of coins and letting them rain down onto the floor. “Who knew a nobody like me could get so lucky? Out of nowhere—poof! I’m rich!” His laugh was hollow and coarse, but his companions indulged him with polite smiles, eyes flicking between him and the growing pile of gold on the table.*
*He staggered to his feet, taking a drunken bow. “To me, Ver! The man of the hour, living the dream!” He raised his glass to the ceiling and drained it in a single gulp. Stumbling, he collapsed back into his chair with a heavy thud, oblivious to the scornful glances from some of the rougher-looking patrons around the room.*
*Ver was flaunting his wealth shamelessly, scattering coins and gems like candy as he bought rounds for the entire brothel. His eyes were dull with intoxication, but every so often, a flicker of something darker passed over his face. Perhaps a shadow of guilt, quickly drowned out by another swig of the rich wine.*

**If the players come up to him and talk to him about his son -** 
*“Silas... Silas who?” he muttered to himself, almost too low to hear, before shoving the thought away with a dismissive shake of his head. He laughed again, raising his voice to a shout. “Who cares! I’m rich now, and that’s all that matters!”*

Probably some murdering of Ver. 

### Funeral Arrangements

You step into a grand, cavernous chamber that feels more like a courtroom crossed with an opulent ballroom than a place for legal business. Rows upon rows of high-backed benches fan out in a half-circle, all filled with well-dressed people whispering and chattering, each craning their necks to catch a glimpse of you as you enter. A massive stained-glass window at the back of the room casts a kaleidoscope of colors across the space, painting everything in vivid hues of red, blue, and gold.

At the center of it all, a high, wooden dais looms over the assembly, draped in rich, royal purple cloths that flutter softly in the breeze coming through the open archways. Behind it sits the presiding figure of the day—a stern, almost caricatured judge dressed in somber black robes, his expression a mix of boredom and faint interest. This is no ordinary courtroom; it’s been transformed for a _celebration of life_—a theatrical send-off for a man who was clearly larger than life.

To your surprise, there’s even a small orchestra off to the side, providing soft, upbeat music that somehow manages to be both celebratory and respectful. Tall bouquets of vibrant flowers line the aisles, their scent mingling with the heady aroma of candles burning in elaborate brass candelabras. People murmur to each other as you and the rest of the party take your seat.

Among the gathered crowd, there are those who wear expressions of genuine grief, but just as many seem to be here out of obligation or even sheer curiosity. [[Derek]] - you catch a few familiar faces—wealthy merchants, city officials, and some of the shadier characters you’ve crossed paths with before—all paying their respects to the late Mister Aberford, the influential man whose death has brought you all here today. [[Valarie]] and [[Shalely]] you also see some professors that you recognize. There is no decriable through-line between them. You think you see your Linguistics teacher, the Culinary Alchemy teacher, the Necrobiology teacher and the astronomy teacher. 

There is an immense mahogany desk set dead center on the dais, piled high with scrolls, documents, and what looks suspiciously like a small chest—probably filled with whatever wealth Mister Aberford left behind. It’s a bequeathment and a spectacle rolled into one, with every eye in the chamber fixed on that desk, waiting to see who will walk away with the spoils.

As all of you are looking around at this crowd of people, your gaze is drawn to two other people seated near the front, standing out even amidst this sea of mourners and opportunists.

To the left of the dais, lounging casually in a chair that looks almost laughably too large for her, is a tall, striking woman dressed in rugged leathers. Her boots are stained with mud, and her gear is clearly meant for the wilderness, not the polished floors of a courthouse. A longbow leans beside her, looking dangerously out of place among the well-dressed crowd. **March, can you describe what they see?**

On the other side of the aisle in stark contrast, sits a **crimson-skinned** tiefling woman, hunched forward as if the very air around her were suffocating. Her hands clutch at the edge of her seat, fingers twitching nervously against the wood. Every so often, her gaze flickers upward, scanning the crowd with a haunted intensity, but she quickly looks away whenever anyone meets her eyes. There’s a strange, raw tension about her—like she’s expecting to be called out at any moment and would crumble the second someone spoke her name. **Mia, can you describe what they see?**

The judge raps his gavel once, twice, drawing the room’s attention as he leans forward, peering over the stacks of paper with a stern look.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he announces, his voice booming in the chamber. “We are gathered here today to honor the memory of the esteemed Mister Aberford, a man of many talents and connections, and to address the matter of his last will and testament.” He gestures grandly toward the assembled guests, a smile creeping onto his lips as he pauses dramatically. “And to see who among you shall benefit from his considerable generosity.”

The proceedings are as grandiose as they are _tedious_. The ceremony begins with the judge launching into a long-winded tribute to Mister Aberford, a speech that seems to drag on for an eternity. A few people in the crowd roll their eyes; others nod solemnly, pretending not to notice the judge stealing glances at his pocket watch between paragraphs.

After the eulogy, representatives from Aberford’s various philanthropic ventures and research projects each take a turn at the podium, delivering speeches that are more self-congratulatory than reverent. Surprisingly some of the professors from [[Kirryan University]] rise one by one to pay their respects—each showcasing their unique eccentricities. [[Professor Thistledown]]’s tribute somehow ends up as a 10-minute lesson on obscure magical runes; [[Professor Vindlebaum]] whips out a portable grill and starts transmuting appetizers for the crowd, much to the judge’s exasperation. [[Professor Windwhisper]] spends her time lost in an abstract poem about the stars, while [[Professor Grimward]] merely nods curtly, offering a terse, “May he rest… for the moment.”

Finally, the judge steps up to the podium again. He gestures to the stack of scrolls and chests laid out on the table before him, drawing a collective gasp from the audience. “Now, we come to the reading of Mister Aberford’s _Last Will and Testament_,” he proclaims. 

One by one, names are called, and items bequeathed: rare artifacts to estranged cousins, properties to minor dignitaries, and pouches of gold to former colleagues. It’s a parade of treasures and rewards, punctuated by gasps of envy and the occasional flash of anger from those who feel they deserved more. A particular painting causes a minor uproar, with a group of siblings practically frothing at the mouth as it’s handed to a distant friend instead.

Finally, the judge reaches the more significant items—the estate and the real wealth. He names Derek among the beneficiaries, to the surprise and murmur of the crowd, bestowing upon him a sprawling, secluded manor on the outskirts of the city. A few curious glances turn Derek’s way, some envious, others puzzled. The announcement of Derek’s inheritance is met with a polite smattering of applause… and more than a few narrowed eyes.

The ceremony concludes with the judge calling forth a final few names—the ranger and Tiefling included—each left with something far more ambiguous than the others: 

"For March's Character something from this table and for Mia's Character, the same. These relics are not mere gifts, but _keys_. Their true nature, Mister Aberford insisted, would only reveal itself at a place most dear to him—_the estate of Greystone Manor_, now in the care of Derek—where all will be made clear."

![[Arc A - Escape From Death House#^BarovianRelicsTable]]

You can practically _feel_ the atmosphere shift as people start making their way to the side chamber—whispering, smirking, or shooting furtive glances at the few chosen beneficiaries. 

"And now I invite you to the celebration", the judge waves his arms and a curtain drops behind him revealing a wide reception hall. 

### After Party Characters

### 1. **Professor Calliope Thistledown**

_Department_: **Enchantments & Linguistics**  
_Description_: A spry, elderly gnome with a shock of white hair that bounces like a cloud when she walks. Professor Thistledown is the resident expert in enchanting everyday objects and deciphering ancient magical scripts. She’s always impeccably dressed in layers of flowing silk robes, glittering with faintly glowing runes that change color based on her mood. Despite her tiny stature, she commands attention with a piercing voice and a sharp wit. She has a habit of unconsciously tracing arcane sigils in the air while she talks, as if her fingers can’t resist the urge to cast even when she’s simply making a point.
_Quirk_: When engaged in conversation, Professor Thistledown will _enchant random objects_ around her without realizing—making quills float, causing chairs to sing, or giving someone’s hat the ability to walk away. It’s harmless, but it’s not uncommon to find a spoon suddenly declaring itself your new best friend if you’re too close to her.

### 2. **Professor Roderick Vindlebaum**

_Department_: **Transmutation & Culinary Alchemy**  
_Description_: A rotund human with rosy cheeks and a bushy mustache, Roderick Vindlebaum looks more like a baker than a professor. He teaches the obscure but surprisingly popular course _Magical Feasts and Enchanted Cooking_. Often seen wearing an apron over his formal robes, he’s infamous for his lectures turning into impromptu banquets—complete with transmuted snacks for everyone. He’s carrying a steaming mug of what smells like magically brewed hot cocoa and keeps absentmindedly nibbling on a floating pastry that follows him around, enchanted to refill itself whenever he finishes a bite.
_Quirk_: He _always_ has food on him—floating plates, miniature enchanted cakes, or self-refilling soup bowls—and insists that others “_simply must_ try this recipe!” He’s obsessed with pairing food and magic, and can be distracted into long rants about his culinary creations, even during serious discussions.

### 3. **Professor Saria Windwhisper**

_Department_: **Astronomy & Celestial Navigation**  
_Description_: A graceful elven woman with long, silvery hair that shimmers like starlight. Professor Windwhisper is a master of both celestial navigation and reading the cosmic patterns that influence arcane energy flows. She’s known for her calm, almost ethereal demeanor, and often speaks in a soft, melodic voice that demands focused attention. Her robes are adorned with constellations that subtly shift and change as the stars move across the sky. Even in the brightly lit chamber, her eyes seem to catch every glimmer of light, giving her a dreamy, far-off look as if she’s only partially present on the material plane.
_Quirk_: Professor Windwhisper has an uncanny ability to _predict things moments before they happen_—not major events, but small details like someone’s sneeze, a glass about to spill, or even what someone will say next. She comments on these predictions almost absentmindedly—“Ah, watch the glass, dear,”—often leaving people unnerved and uncertain whether it’s insight or just luck.

### 4. **Professor Bartholomew Grimward**

_Department_: **Necrobiology & Applied Hematurgy**  
_Description_: A gaunt, severe-looking man with slicked-back black hair and a piercing gaze. Professor Grimward specializes in the study of life and death, delving into the borderline fields of necromancy and blood magic (strictly for research purposes, of course). Dressed in stark black robes with crimson trim, he looks more like an undertaker than a scholar, and there’s an unspoken rule among the students not to attend his office hours alone. He rarely speaks above a whisper, but when he does, his words carry a chilling weight. He stands apart from the rest of the attendees, arms folded, watching the proceedings with a detached, clinical interest.
_Quirk_: Despite his grim demeanor, Grimward has an unexpected _obsession with puns and morbid jokes_. He finds dark humor in everything—“Ah, just another grave situation”—and often leaves students and colleagues baffled by his unexpected levity amid serious discussions. He never smiles, though, so it’s impossible to tell if he’s joking or serious.
- **"Life is a _grave_ matter, but I always try to keep it _light_—you know, for _undead_ spirits!"**
- **"People say I’m a _bit morbid_, but I like to think of it as having a _healthy curiosity_ about what lies _beyond_."**
- **"You know, it’s all about _balance_—too much life or too much death can really throw off your _hematology_!"**
- **"I once tried to make a _skeleton_ laugh, but I guess I just didn’t have the _guts_!"**
- **"Necromancy is a _dying art_, but I’m here to make it _revive_—with a little practice, of course!"**
- **"I always say, if you can’t find the _soul_ of a problem, it’s probably time to _raise_ some questions!"**

- **"Some people think my studies are a little _dead on arrival_, but I find them _thrilling_! It’s like living on the _edge of the grave_!"**
    
- **"Ah, the beauty of necromancy—_death_ is just another way of saying you’re not _living_ life to the fullest!"**
    
- **"I had a friend who wanted to become a _mummy_, but he just couldn’t handle the _wrapping_!"**
    
- **"Remember, my dear students, in the world of magic, sometimes you have to _dig deep_ to uncover the _bones of truth_!"**

### 5. **Lady Claribel Thorne**

_Role_: **Potion Magnate & Society Matriarch**  
_Description_: A larger-than-life woman in a vivid, emerald-green gown, Lady Thorne is a force of nature. With a fan of peacock feathers and enough jewelry to buy a small kingdom, she practically radiates power and affluence. Despite her advanced age, her presence is commanding, and she exudes a blend of charisma and menace. She’s infamous for her monopoly over the region’s potion market and for wielding social connections like a knife in the dark. Always eager to involve herself in other people’s affairs, she delights in subtle manipulation and getting what she wants—whether through charm or intimidation.  
_Quirk_: Speaks in the third person—“Claribel thinks that estate would make _such_ a lovely investment”—giving off an air of theatrical self-importance.

### 6. **Leonard Wispwhittle**

_Role_: **Curator of the Aberford Private Collection**  
_Description_: A reedy half-elf with a shock of white hair and glasses that magnify his eyes comically, Leonard looks perpetually startled. His clothing is fine but rumpled, and his hands flutter nervously whenever someone mentions the collection. As Aberford’s personal curator, he was responsible for cataloguing and guarding the deceased’s many rare and magical artifacts—an arduous task that clearly frayed his nerves over the years. Leonard has an encyclopedic knowledge of Aberford’s acquisitions, from priceless grimoires to cursed baubles, but he speaks in a distracted, jittery manner, as if afraid one of the relics might suddenly explode.  
_Quirk_: Constantly mutters to himself, sometimes revealing snippets of information accidentally—“No, no, the _arcane ward_ shouldn’t activate unless… Oh dear, did I remember to lock the vault?”

### 7. **Gideon “The Dapper Duke” Arkwright**

_Role_: **Infamous Gambler & Master of Coin**  
_Description_: A devilishly handsome human with slick black hair, sharp cheekbones, and a smile that suggests he’s three steps ahead of everyone in the room. Dressed in an immaculately tailored crimson suit, Gideon is the epitome of refined danger. Known throughout the city as a master gambler and financial tactician, he’s as notorious for his high-stakes wins as he is for his subtle manipulations of the city’s wealth. Gideon speaks with a honeyed tongue, making even the most devious proposal sound like an opportunity too good to pass up. He always seems to know more than he should—about you, your friends, and especially your weaknesses.  
_Quirk_: He idly shuffles a deck of cards during conversations, never looking down, and occasionally pulls out a card that seems _strangely appropriate_ for whomever he’s speaking to.

### 8. **Mistress Helvara Brightsword**

_Role_: **Commander of the City Guard & Aberford’s Former Bodyguard**  
_Description_: Towering and muscular, Helvara stands out in the well-dressed crowd like a bear at a dinner party. She’s dressed in a gleaming, rune-etched breastplate, the only concession to formality being a dark velvet cloak clasped at her shoulder with a family crest. Her short-cropped hair and stern demeanor make it clear she’s not here to socialize. A former adventurer who became Aberford’s personal bodyguard for a decade, she now serves as Commander of the City Guard—though she still carries the weight of old grudges and secrets. Helvara has a surprisingly dry sense of humor, but very few are brave enough to engage her long enough to see it.  
_Quirk_: Tends to let others speak first, silently watching with an unsettling intensity before finally weighing in with a single, cutting comment that usually ends the conversation.

### 9. **Barnaby Bilgeworth**

_Role_: **Local Bard & Occasional Cat Burglar**  
_Description_: A flamboyant gnome with a shock of curly orange hair, a bright patchwork vest, and a wide-brimmed hat adorned with a single, absurdly long feather. Barnaby is equal parts entertainer and rogue, flitting through the room with the grace of a dancer and the mischief of a fox. His nimble fingers are just as skilled at playing the lute as they are at lifting purses, and he seems to know every secret, rumor, and backdoor deal in the city. He has a laugh that’s infectious and a smile that never quite reaches his eyes. Many people know him, but few trust him—if Barnaby’s interested in you, there’s usually trouble close behind.  
_Quirk_: Frequently bursts into impromptu verse or ballads about the people around him, using his songs to praise, insult, or reveal uncomfortable truths—all with a grin on his face.
