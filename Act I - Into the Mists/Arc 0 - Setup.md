*A continuation of the Kirryan Adventure*

The party comes out of the cave that has collapsed in on the [[Obsidian Heart]]. They go and find [[Silas]] a place to stay and presumably go and find his father (Ver), who is drunk at a brothel. 

### Deerick's Bar Confronting Ver

*The bar is filled with the haze of cheap perfume and the low murmur of laughter, and you see Ver lounged back in a plush chair, a half-empty bottle of expensive elven wine dangling carelessly from his hand. He looked nothing like the desperate father who had burst into Deerick's Bar just days ago and begged you to find his son —his eyes were glazed over, his face flushed, and his clothes far richer than the simple attire he had worn before.*
*Ver grinned sloppily, gold bracelets clinking as he waved at one of the women to bring him another drink. “Another round for everyone! On me!” he declared, raising his glass high. Several patrons cheered, toasting him with raised mugs. He leaned back, laughing loudly, spilling some of the wine as he turned to one of the girls at his side.*
*“Can you believe it?” he slurred, clutching a fistful of coins and letting them rain down onto the floor. “Who knew a nobody like me could get so lucky? Out of nowhere—poof! I’m rich!” His laugh was hollow and coarse, but his companions indulged him with polite smiles, eyes flicking between him and the growing pile of gold on the table.*
*He staggered to his feet, taking a drunken bow. “To me, Ver! The man of the hour, living the dream!” He raised his glass to the ceiling and drained it in a single gulp. Stumbling, he collapsed back into his chair with a heavy thud, oblivious to the scornful glances from some of the rougher-looking patrons around the room.*
*Ver was flaunting his wealth shamelessly, scattering coins and gems like candy as he bought rounds for the entire brothel. His eyes were dull with intoxication, but every so often, a flicker of something darker passed over his face. Perhaps a shadow of guilt, quickly drowned out by another swig of the rich wine.*

**If the players come up to him and talk to him about his son -** 
*“Silas... Silas who?” he muttered to himself, almost too low to hear, before shoving the thought away with a dismissive shake of his head. He laughed again, raising his voice to a shout. “Who cares! I’m rich now, and that’s all that matters!”*

Probably some murdering of Ver.
