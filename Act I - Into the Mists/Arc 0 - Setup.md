*A continuation of the Kirryan Adventure*

The party comes out of the cave that has collapsed in on the [[Obsidian Heart]]. They go and find [[Silas]] a place to stay and presumably go and find his father (Ver), who is drunk at a brothel. 

### Deerick's Bar Confronting Ver

*The bar is filled with the haze of cheap perfume and the low murmur of laughter, and you see Ver lounged back in a plush chair, a half-empty bottle of expensive elven wine dangling carelessly from his hand. He looked nothing like the desperate father who had burst into Deerick's Bar just days ago and begged you to find his son —his eyes were glazed over, his face flushed, and his clothes far richer than the simple attire he had worn before.*
*Ver grinned sloppily, gold bracelets clinking as he waved at one of the women to bring him another drink. “Another round for everyone! On me!” he declared, raising his glass high. Several patrons cheered, toasting him with raised mugs. He leaned back, laughing loudly, spilling some of the wine as he turned to one of the girls at his side.*
*“Can you believe it?” he slurred, clutching a fistful of coins and letting them rain down onto the floor. “Who knew a nobody like me could get so lucky? Out of nowhere—poof! I’m rich!” His laugh was hollow and coarse, but his companions indulged him with polite smiles, eyes flicking between him and the growing pile of gold on the table.*
*He staggered to his feet, taking a drunken bow. “To me, Ver! The man of the hour, living the dream!” He raised his glass to the ceiling and drained it in a single gulp. Stumbling, he collapsed back into his chair with a heavy thud, oblivious to the scornful glances from some of the rougher-looking patrons around the room.*
*Ver was flaunting his wealth shamelessly, scattering coins and gems like candy as he bought rounds for the entire brothel. His eyes were dull with intoxication, but every so often, a flicker of something darker passed over his face. Perhaps a shadow of guilt, quickly drowned out by another swig of the rich wine.*

**If the players come up to him and talk to him about his son -** 
*“Silas... Silas who?” he muttered to himself, almost too low to hear, before shoving the thought away with a dismissive shake of his head. He laughed again, raising his voice to a shout. “Who cares! I’m rich now, and that’s all that matters!”*

Probably some murdering of Ver. 

### Funeral Arrangements

You step into a grand, cavernous chamber that feels more like a courtroom crossed with an opulent ballroom than a place for legal business. Rows upon rows of high-backed benches fan out in a half-circle, all filled with well-dressed people whispering and chattering, each craning their necks to catch a glimpse of you as you enter. A massive stained-glass window at the back of the room casts a kaleidoscope of colors across the space, painting everything in vivid hues of red, blue, and gold.

At the center of it all, a high, wooden dais looms over the assembly, draped in rich, royal purple cloths that flutter softly in the breeze coming through the open archways. Behind it sits the presiding figure of the day—a stern, almost caricatured judge dressed in somber black robes, his expression a mix of boredom and faint interest. This is no ordinary courtroom; it’s been transformed for a _celebration of life_—a theatrical send-off for a man who was clearly larger than life.

To your surprise, there’s even a small orchestra off to the side, providing soft, upbeat music that somehow manages to be both celebratory and respectful. Tall bouquets of vibrant flowers line the aisles, their scent mingling with the heady aroma of candles burning in elaborate brass candelabras. People murmur to each other as you and the rest of the party take your seat.

Among the gathered crowd, there are those who wear expressions of genuine grief, but just as many seem to be here out of obligation or even sheer curiosity. [[Derek]] - you catch a few familiar faces—wealthy merchants, city officials, and some of the shadier characters you’ve crossed paths with before—all paying their respects to the late Mister Aberford, the influential man whose death has brought you all here today. [[Valarie]] and [[Shalely]] you also see some professors that you recognize. There is no decriable through-line between them. You think you see your Linguistics teacher, the Culinary Alchemy teacher, the Necrobiology teacher and the astronomy teacher. 

There is an immense mahogany desk set dead center on the dais, piled high with scrolls, documents, and what looks suspiciously like a small chest—probably filled with whatever wealth Mister Aberford left behind. It’s a bequeathment and a spectacle rolled into one, with every eye in the chamber fixed on that desk, waiting to see who will walk away with the spoils.

As all of you are looking around at this crowd of people, your gaze is drawn to two other people seated near the front, standing out even amidst this sea of mourners and opportunists.

To the left of the dais, lounging casually in a chair that looks almost laughably too large for her, is a tall, striking woman dressed in rugged leathers. Her boots are stained with mud, and her gear is clearly meant for the wilderness, not the polished floors of a courthouse. A longbow leans beside her, looking dangerously out of place among the well-dressed crowd. **March, can you describe what they see?**

On the other side of the aisle in stark contrast, sits a **crimson-skinned** tiefling woman, hunched forward as if the very air around her were suffocating. Her hands clutch at the edge of her seat, fingers twitching nervously against the wood. Every so often, her gaze flickers upward, scanning the crowd with a haunted intensity, but she quickly looks away whenever anyone meets her eyes. There’s a strange, raw tension about her—like she’s expecting to be called out at any moment and would crumble the second someone spoke her name. **Mia, can you describe what they see?**

The judge raps his gavel once, twice, drawing the room’s attention as he leans forward, peering over the stacks of paper with a stern look.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he announces, his voice booming in the chamber. “We are gathered here today to honor the memory of the esteemed Mister Aberford, a man of many talents and connections, and to address the matter of his last will and testament.” He gestures grandly toward the assembled guests, a smile creeping onto his lips as he pauses dramatically. “And to see who among you shall benefit from his considerable generosity.”

The proceedings are as grandiose as they are _tedious_. The ceremony begins with the judge launching into a long-winded tribute to Mister Aberford, a speech that seems to drag on for an eternity. A few people in the crowd roll their eyes; others nod solemnly, pretending not to notice the judge stealing glances at his pocket watch between paragraphs.

After the eulogy, representatives from Aberford’s various philanthropic ventures and research projects each take a turn at the podium, delivering speeches that are more self-congratulatory than reverent. Surprisingly some of the professors from [[Kirryan University]] rise one by one to pay their respects—each showcasing their unique eccentricities. [[Professor Thistledown]]’s tribute somehow ends up as a 10-minute lesson on obscure magical runes; [[Professor Vindlebaum]] whips out a portable grill and starts transmuting appetizers for the crowd, much to the judge’s exasperation. [[Professor Windwhisper]] spends her time lost in an abstract poem about the stars, while [[Professor Grimward]] merely nods curtly, offering a terse, “May he rest… for the moment.”

Finally, the judge steps up to the podium again. He gestures to the stack of scrolls and chests laid out on the table before him, drawing a collective gasp from the audience. “Now, we come to the reading of Mister Aberford’s _Last Will and Testament_,” he proclaims. 

One by one, names are called, and items bequeathed: rare artifacts to estranged cousins, properties to minor dignitaries, and pouches of gold to former colleagues. It’s a parade of treasures and rewards, punctuated by gasps of envy and the occasional flash of anger from those who feel they deserved more. A particular painting causes a minor uproar, with a group of siblings practically frothing at the mouth as it’s handed to a distant friend instead.

Finally, the judge reaches the more significant items—the estate and the real wealth. He names Derek among the beneficiaries, to the surprise and murmur of the crowd, bestowing upon him a sprawling, secluded manor on the outskirts of the city. A few curious glances turn Derek’s way, some envious, others puzzled. The announcement of Derek’s inheritance is met with a polite smattering of applause… and more than a few narrowed eyes.

The ceremony concludes with the judge calling forth a final few names—the ranger and Tiefling included—each left with something far more ambiguous than the others: 

* ***Stone Crest.*** The crest emits a low hum and smells of pine needles and earthy soil, which both grow stronger when the crest is moved toward Death House.
* ***Broken Blade.*** The blade emits a high-pitched hum and begins to tremble violently, spinning like a compass needle in the direction of Death House.
* ***Dragon's Scale.*** The scale burns icy cold, one end glowing with a bright, silver light in the direction of Death House.
* ***Sunrise Medallion.*** The medallion shines with a warm, golden glow, emitting rays of bright light in the direction of Death House.
* ***Amber Shard.*** The shard glows with amber light and tugs its cord in the direction of Death House.
* ***Wolf's Tooth.*** The tooth lengthens, glowing with silver moonlight, and tugs its cord in the direction of Death House.
* ***Crumpled Page.*** The ink on the page glows with amber light, the runes reshaping themselves into a map that shows the page's location—and an arrow that guides toward Death House.
* ***Tattered Banner.*** The sound of war-drums fills the air, and the banner blows in an unseen wind in the direction of Death House.
* ***Electrum Coin.*** The coin lands on its edge and begins rolling across the muddy cobblestones in the direction of Death House.
* ***Angel's Feather.*** The feather is swept away by an unseen wind, its barbs glimmering with golden light as it twirls through the streets toward Death House.
* ***Raven's Feather.*** The feather is swept away by the wind, its shadow seeming to dance in the air, as it twirls through the streets toward Death House.
* ***Wanderer's Scarf.*** The scarf is carried away by the wind, its patterns shifting and turning in the air as it whirls through the streets toward Death House.

You can practically _feel_ the atmosphere shift as people start making their way to the side chamber—whispering, smirking, or shooting furtive glances at the few chosen beneficiaries. The after-party is where the real maneuvering will begin.
