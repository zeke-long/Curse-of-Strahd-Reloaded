## Background
Norbert is an anomaly. Not very smart and the only remainder of his kind, he has been wandering the world and has recently found residence in [[Kirryan City]], where he works as a gardener for [[Kirryan University]] where he met [[Derek]].

On a usual night in the pub with [[Derek]], he meets [[Valarie]] and [[Shalely]] who take on a mission to find [[Silas]] who has been presumably kidnapped by somebody in the city. His father pleads to the party to go find and help his son.
