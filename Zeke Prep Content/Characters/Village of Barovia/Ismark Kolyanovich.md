## Interactions
When met - he invites the characters to join him, offers to pay for their wine, and asks for their aid in protecting his adopted sister, [[Ireena Kolyana]]. If they agree to help, he takes them to [[E4 - Burgomasterâ€™s Mansion]]. He wants the characters to help him escort Ireena to [[Vallaki]] beyond the view of [[Castle Ravenloft]] and (he hopes) beyond the reach of Strahd. This is a risk, but he wants to keep her safe. He does not know why, but he does know Strahd is wildly attracted to Ireena.

If the players do not help him or offer to help - he does not tell them much. 

He will join the party (if they ask) after they get Ireena to Vallaki.
