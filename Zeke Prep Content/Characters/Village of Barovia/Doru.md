## Character Traits
[[Doru]] is not brave enough to attack the characters, but pleads for blood. If they get too close he can "smell their blood" and will take a swipe if they are too close. 

## Knowledge 
A little more than a year ago, Doru and several other villagers stormed [[Castle Ravenloft]] in revolt, having been lured there by a wizard in black robes ([[Mad Mage]]) who came to Barovia from a faraway land. He was bitten in this revolt and turned into a [[Vampire Spawn]]. His father trapped him in the undercroft since.
