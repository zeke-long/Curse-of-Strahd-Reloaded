## Character Traits

*A striking young woman with auburn hair, who appears demure and beaten down by life in Barovia. She has a vacant expression, but looking deeper into her eyes you see a spark that is not present for everyone you have met.*
^WhatToRead

Ireena, a striking young woman with auburn hair, has been bitten twice by Strahd. The villagers are afraid of her and avoid her. The characters are Ireena's best hope for protection, so she is willing to accompany them under certain conditions. Although she appears mild, she has a strong will, and she aids the party as best she can in saving herself. 
## Knowledge
### Meeting Her
Will probably meet in [[E4 - Burgomasterâ€™s Mansion]].

She tells the characters that wolves and other terrible creatures attacked the house night after night for weeks. The burgomaster's heart couldn't stand the constant assault, and he died three days ago. 

Strangely, since his death, the house has not come under attack. She says that no one from the village has been brave enough to help [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] take [[Kolyan lndirovich]] to the cemetery for proper burial. Ireena asks the characters if they would be so kind as to help Ismark deliver her father's body safely to [[Donavich]], the local priest (area [[E5 - Church]]). She refuses to be taken to [[Vallaki]] or anywhere else while the burgomaster lies dead on the mansion floor.

She doesn't remember her early past. She doesn't know how she came to Barovia or where she came from. Moreover, her encounters with Strahd are fuzzy memories, thanks to his vampiric charm, but she can recall clearly the blazing hunger in his eyes.
