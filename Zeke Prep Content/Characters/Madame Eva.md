## Character Traits

**Ideal.** "I wish Strahd to be free of his curse."
**Bond.** "The Vistani are my people now."
**Flaw.** "The people whose fates I divine aren't important. They are but the means to an end."

***Royal Blood.*** Madam Eva is Strahd's half-sister, though Strahd is unaware of this fact. Her real name is Katarina, and she is the daughter of a [[Vistani]] woman whom King Barov, Strahd's father, took to his bed during one of his many crusades. Madam Eva knows she is Strahd's half-sister but has told no one of the royal blood flowing through her veins.

***[[Night Mother]]*** Over four hundred years ago Katarina came to [[Barovia]] and began to work in Strahd's court as a maid. She was present for the marriage of [[Sergi]] and [[Tatyana]]. After Strahd went mad she ran and took refuge with the Vistani. She made a pact with the [[Night Mother]], who transformed her into an ageless crone with magical foresight in exchange for undoing the evil that Strahd did. She uses this ability to bring adventurers into Barovia with the goal of either killing the vampire or freeing Strahd. 

***For the Love of Strahd.*** The [[Dark Powers]] would be okay replacing Strahd with Katarina, but she does not want this. She would rather help Strahd and find someone else to replace him as the vessel for the Dark Powers, but doubts that she will be able to.
