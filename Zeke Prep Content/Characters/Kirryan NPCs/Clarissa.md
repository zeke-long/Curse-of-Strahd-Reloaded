## Character Traits
She lives in the dead of [[Derek]] now. 

Has an interesting relationship with Derek. Starting to be interested in him, but is now trapped in his head. She used to be trapped in a glass orb in a dungeon though so that is not ideal. 

## Background
She was part of the [[Priests of Osybus]] ![[Priests of Osybus#Kirryan Sect]]
She began to doubt in the [[Dark Powers]] and was then trapped in a glass orb as punishment. 

She was picked up by [[Derek]] and was carried through as the party tried to save [[Silas]]. Eventually in killing [[Grand Master Malachi]] and his partner [[Grand Master Sandra]], Derek threw Clarissa's orb into the [[Obsidian Heart]], which powered magic via [[Dark Powers]]. This worked, but Derek was hit by a Wild Magic meteor. When he was revied (also using the Dark Powers), Clarissa was implanted in his head.
