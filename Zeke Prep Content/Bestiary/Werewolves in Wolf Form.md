*You hear the howl of a wolf some distance away.*

Werewolves in wolf form follow the party from a safe distance for several hours. If their Stealth checks exceed party's passive Perception scores, the werewolves attack with surprise when the characters decide to take a short or long rest. Otherwise, they wait until the characters are weakened by another random encounter before moving in for the easy kill.
