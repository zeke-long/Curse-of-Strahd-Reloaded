The Tome of Strahd is an ancient work penned by Strahd, a tragic tale of how he came to his fallen state. The book is bound in a thick leather cover with steel hinges and fastenings. The pages are of parchment and very brittle. Most of the book is written in the curious shorthand that only Strahd employs. Stains and age have made most of the work illegible, but several paragraphs remain intact and readable. Contains the contents below. 

If Strahd sees, or learns from a minion, that the tome has fallen into the party's possession, all of his other objectives are put on hold until the book is recovered. When Strahd attacks, his preferred target is whoever has the tome.

## From the Tome of Strahd

_I am ancient. I am the land. My beginnings are lost in the darkness of the past. But here for my own remembrance I record my tale of woe, for as the countless centuries pass I fear even my own memory may one day begin to fade. As this curse takes everything from me, I feel evermore that I am sustained by hatred alone- I must try to remember my true purpose, and the treachery of those who brought me to this._

_I was a warrior. I was good and I was just. I thundered across the land like the wrath of a mighty god. But the warring years and the killing years weighed on my soul. My campaigns, my responsibilities, my family honour… they wore me down as the wind wears stone to dust. I found my youth and strength dwindling, and in time all goodness began to slip from my life._

_My army settled in the valley of Barovia and took power over the people here. I erected a mighty monument to my house, Castle Ravenloft. I called for my family, long unseated from their rightful thrones, and brought them here to rule again as they once did. They brought with them my younger brother, Sergei. He was handsome and youthful, and reminded me of what I was no longer. I quickly grew to hate him, but I looked toward other matters._

_From the families of the valley, one spirit shone above all others – a rare beauty. Among the villagers she was called a “joy” and a “treasure.” I called her Perfection. Her name was Tatyana._

_How I longed for her to be mine! In her youth I saw what I had lost, and in her joy I saw what I had forgotten. I loved her, and my heart was all but hers! But alas her heart was not mine. “Old one” she called me, “elder,” and finally – “brother.” Her heart went to Sergei. They were betrothed, and a date was set. They were to be married within the halls of my own castle. I saw the last chance I had for happiness slipping away from me, and for the first time I was powerless to stop it._

_With her tongue she called me brother, but her eyes reflected another name: Death. It was the death of the aged that she saw in me. She loved her youth and enjoyed it fully, but mine was gone, squandered on brash campaigns and family honour. The death she saw turned her away from me, and so I came to hate death all the more. What was once a simple inevitability became an anathema to me._

_My hate grew strong! I would not be called by death’s name so soon! I heard whispers of an ancient power, a temple in the south of Barovia. The powers that spoke to me there I  will not detail on these pages, for so dark were their words that even I shudder to think of them again… but great indeed was my desperation. And so I made a pact with the darkness, a pact of eternal life, and on the day of his wedding I killed my brother Sergei and sealed my pact with his blood! When they saw what I had done the castle guards pierced my flesh with their arrows, yet I did not die. Nor did I live. I became un-dead._

_Tatyana fled. I found her weeping in the garden east of the chapel. She ran from me, she would not let me explain, and a great anger swelled within me. I had to make her understand that the pact I made was made for her! I pursued her, and finally in despair she flung herself from the walls of Ravenloft. In that everlasting moment everything I wanted in this life fell from my grasp forever._

_It was a thousand feet through the mists. No trace of her was ever found. But no souls can leave this land of mine, and so her soul must be here, somewhere. Oft I have hunted these lands for her. Oft I have felt her soul within my grasp, trapped in the body of another, but always she escapes. How she taunts me! What will it take to bend her love to me?_

_I have studied much since then. “Vampyr” is my new name. I still lust for life and youth, and I curse the living that took them from me. Many have tried to overthrow me over the centuries. Their foolish souls are now damned to walk the lands for all eternity, while their desecrated corpses rot beneath my cold earth!_

_It is the sun and the light I fear the most now, but little else can harm me. Even a stake through my heart will not kill me (though it will hold me for a time). But the sword! My brother’s accursed sword! I must do away with that fell tool, if only I could find it! I hate and fear that sword as I hate the sun and fear the dawn! He had with him also a sigil of our house, a memory of what I was before this curse. I must destroy it as well, for even the sight of it makes me weak. Knowing they persist angers me, yet their whereabouts remain elusive._

_Now I reside far below Ravenloft. I live among the dead and sleep among the stones in this dark fortress of my despair. Someday I shall seal shut these walls so that none may ever disturb me again._
