# What To Read
*A figure walks alone with the stride and bearing of one who knows no fear. Clad in rusty armor, it clutches a gleaming longsword in its pale hand and looks ready for a fight.*

## If players are against Strahd - Encounter
If the characters present themselves as enemies of Strahd, the revenant urges them to travel to [[Argynvostholt]] and convince [[Vladimir Horngaard]], the leader of the [[Order of the Silver Dragon]], to help them. The revenant would like nothing more than to kill Strahd, but it will not venture to [[Castle Ravenloft]] unless it receives orders to do so from Vladimir. If the characters ask the revenant to lead them to Horngaard in Argynvostholt, it does so while avoiding contact with Barovian settlements.
