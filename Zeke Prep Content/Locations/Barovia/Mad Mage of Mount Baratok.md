## What to Read
*North of the mountain lake, the trees begin their steady climb up the slopes of [[Mount Baratok]], its monolithic presence oppressive at this distance. The ground here is rocky, uneven, and tiring to navigate. Even the wolves avoid this neck of the woods. Soon, you climb above the blanket of fog that engulfs the valley. Dark thunderclouds roll overhead.
You see an elk standing on a rocky spur about sixty feet away. Suddenly, it assumes the form of a man in tattered black robes. His hair and beard are long, black, and streaked with gray, and his eyes crackle with eldritch power.*

## Encounter - [[Mad Mage]]
- Believing that the characters aim to kill him, the Mad Mage unleashes his destructive magic. As he tears into them, he shouts, "You think my magic has grown weak? Think again!" 
- If he is reduced to 50 hit points or fewer, he shouts, "Tell your dark masters they can break my body, but never my spirit!" He then tries to escape.

### Understanding the Mad Mage

### Saving the Mage
If the characters rescue the archmage from his madness, he invites them to his "mansion." He leads them up the mountain to an invisible doorway that serves as the entrance to his extradimensional lair, created using the [[Mordenkainen's Magnificent Mansion]] spell. There, he provides them with food and sanctuary away from the prying eyes of Strahd and his spies. 

Characters are free to take a short or long rest, during which time they aren't disturbed.
He declines to join them if asked to go with the party. With his wits restored, he sets out to find his missing staff and spellbook, leaving the characters on their own. He doesn't allow them to help him, for he fears they might be tempted to steal either his staff or his spellbook. (Being an adventurer himself, he knows how the lure of powerful magic can bring out the worst in adventurers.) 

Before he leaves, as a parting gift, he imbues each character with a [[Charm of Heroism]].
