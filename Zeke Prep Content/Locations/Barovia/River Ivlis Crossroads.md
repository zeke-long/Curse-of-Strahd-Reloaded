## What to Read
*An old wooden gallows creaks in a chill wind that blows down from the high ground to the west. A frayed length of rope dances from its beam. The well-worn road splits here, and a signpost opposite the gallows points off in three directions: [[Village of Barovia]] to the east, [[Tser Pool]] to the northwest, and [[Castle Ravenloft]]/[[Vallaki]] to the southwest. The northwest fork slants down and disappears into the trees, while the southwest fork clings to an upward slope. Across from the gallows, a low wall, crumbling in places, partially encloses a small plot of graves shrouded in fog.*


# The Hanged One: 
- *You hear a creaking noise behind you, coming from the gallows. Where there was nothing before now hangs a lifeless, gray body. The breeze turns the hanged figure slowly, so that it can fix its dead eyes upon you.*
- One random character sees themself hanging in the wind
- The corpse looks and smells real, and it rapidly melts away into nothing if touched or moved.
