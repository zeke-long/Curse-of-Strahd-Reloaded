## What to Read

**From [[Tser Pool Encampment]]** - *You follow the river to the base of a canyon, at the far end of which a great waterfall spills into a pool, billowing forth clouds of cold mist. A great stone bridge spans the canyon nearly one thousand feet overhead.*

**On the High Road** - *You follow the dirt road as it clings to the side of a mountain and ends before an arching bridge of molden crusted stone that spans a natural chasm. Gargoyles cloaked in black moss perch on the corners of the bridge, their frowns weatherworn. On the mountainous side of the bridge, a waterfall spills into a misty pool nearly a thousand feet below. The pool feeds a river that meanders into the fog-shrouded pines that blanket the valley.*

The bridge is slick with moisture but safe to cross. The road south of the bridge leads down the mountainside to [[River Ivlis Crossroads]]; the road north cuts through the mountains to [[Black Carraige]].
