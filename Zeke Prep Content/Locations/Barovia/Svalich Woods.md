## What to Read
*Towering trees, whose tops are lost in heavy gray mist, block out all but a death-gray light. The tree trunks are unnaturally close to one another, and the woods have the silence of a forgotten grave, yet exude the feeling of an unvoiced scream.*

Character with the best [[Passive Perception]] - *You catch the scent of death on the air.*

## Encounter
*The foul scent leads you to a human corpse half-buried in the underbrush about fifteen feet from the road. The young man appears to be a commoner. His muddy clothes are torn and raked with claw marks. Crows have been at the body, which is surrounded by the paw prints. The man has obviously been dead for several days. He holds a crumpled envelope in one hand.*

[[Dalvan Olensky]] lies dead in the road. The letter in Dalvan's hand has a large "B" set into its wax seal. The parchment is worn and flimsy. It is [[Kolyan lndirovich's Letter (Version 2)]], dated one week ago.

The characters hear a lone wolf in the distance. If they do not move relatively quickly - five [[Dire Wolves]] approach and try to kill the players unless they get back on the road towards the [[Village of Barovia]].
