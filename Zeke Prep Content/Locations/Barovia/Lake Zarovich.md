## What to Read
*At the foot of a mountain, nestled in the misty forest, is a large lake. The water is perfectly still and dark, reflecting the black clouds overhead like a monstrous mirror.*

### Additional Details


## Encounter - Bluto
*Pulled up along the south shore are three small rowboats. A fourth boat can be seen in the middle of the lake, with a lone figure sitting in it, fishing pole in hand.*

- The person fishing on the lake is [[Bluto Krogarov]] (NE male human [[commoner]]), a resident of [[Vallaki]].
- His boat is 400 feet from the nearest shore. 
- [[Arabelle]] (LN female human [[commoner]] with 2 hit points and no effective attacks) a seven-year-old Vistana is tied up in a boat. 
	- She is bound with hempen rope, wrapped in a burlap sack, and lying prone so that she can't be seen or heard from the shore.
- If the characters watch Bluto from the shore for several minutes, or if they row out into the lake to greet him, he tosses the burlap sack into the water, watches it sink, and waits with fishing pole in hand for his reward.

If rescued, she demands to be returned to her family's camp outside Vallaki ( #todo chapter 5, area N9). She is certain that her father, [[Luvash]], will give the characters a reward for doing so.
