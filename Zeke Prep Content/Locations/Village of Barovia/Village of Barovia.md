## What To Read
*Tall shapes loom out of the dense fog that surrounds ev­erything. The muddy ground underfoot gives way to slick, wet cobblestones. The tall shapes become recognizable as village dwellings. The windows of each house stare out from pools of blackness. No sound cuts the silence except for mournful sobbing that echoes through the streets from a distance.*
^WhatToRead

## [[E7 - Death House]]
If running the Death House mini-adventure.
### On Entering:
*The gravel road leads to a village, its tall houses dark as tombstones. Nestled among these solemn dwellings are a handful of closed-up shops. Even the tavern is shut tight.

*A soft whimpering draws your eye toward a pair of children standing in the middle of an otherwise life­ less street.*

### If Interacting with [[Rose]] or [[Thorn]]
*After shushing the boy, the girl turns to you and says, "There's a monster in our house!" She then points to a tall brick row house that has seen better days. Its windows are dark. It has a gated portico on the ground floor, and the rusty gate is slightly ajar. The houses on either side are abandoned, their windows and doors boarded up.*

#### Additional Info
- Don’t know anything about the monster, but it has a terrible howl (actually the yells of the victims of the cult)
- Their parents ([[Gustav Durst]] and [[Elizabeth Durst]]) keep the monsters trapped in the basement (still not true - that's where the cult stuff happens)
- There’s a baby (Bud) trapped in the third floor nursery (Untrue - but will pass deception checks)

#### Additional GM Info
- Rose and Thorn are dead, they starved after being forgotten in the attic
- Describe a toy or something that Thorn is holding to then appear in [[Death House - Area 20 - Children's Room]]

#### Dream Pastries
At some point while the characters are in the Village. 

*You hear the sound of small, wooden wheels rolling across damp cobbles. You trace the lonely sound to a hunched figure bundled in rags, pushing a rickety wooden cart through the fog.*
^WhatToReadDreamPastries

[[Morgantha]] in the guise of an old woman, comes from [[Old Bonegrinder]] to sell her [[Dream Pastries]] for 1gp each. She goes house to house and tries to sell her stuff. She understands the party are strangers and tries to avoid them. 

##### If they follow her
She eventually collects payment from one household in the form of a seven-year-old boy named [[Lucian Jarov]]. Lucian's parents plead with Morgantha not to take their boy, but she snatches the crying child from their grasp, stuffs him in a sack, straps him down to her cart, and casually makes her way back to [[Old Bonegrinder]].

She will give up the boy if requested (knowing she will come back later).

If further threatened she will bargain with:
