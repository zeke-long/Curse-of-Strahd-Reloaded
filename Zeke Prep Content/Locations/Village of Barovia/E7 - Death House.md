## Intro

### Level Ups
- When characters gain access to [[Death House - Area 21 - Secret Stairs]] they go to [[Level 2]]
- When characters escape from the Death House they go to [[Level 3]]

### History
- Death House is an old row house in the [[Village of Barovia]].
- It continually burns down and comes back by its own will or that of Strahd.
- It was rich people getting their freak on with a cult of dark magic (potentially the magic of the [[Dark Powers]])
- They were mad into [[Strahd von Zarovich]] but were ultimately turned away by him because he was too cool from them and he thought they were untrustworthy
- They fucking ate people
- One time they ate Strahd’s guests and then he came and killed them all

### Relevant GM Info
- Death House is a big fan of the cult and just kinda does cult shit by itself
- The house has four stories, two balconies on the third floor, one in the front and one in the back
- Wooden floors throughout and all the windows swing outward
- Floors 1 and 2 are **nice** and they are well kept
- Floors 3 and Attic are a shit show 
	- *These areas are dusty and drafty, everything within them is old and draped in cobwebs, and the floorboards groan underfoot.*
- No rooms are lit when the characters get there, but they have working oil lamps

## Ending

### The Cult is Appeased
Death House harbors no ill will toward a party willing to sacrifice a life to appease the cult. Once the sacrifice is made, the characters are free to go. Upon emerging from the house, the characters advance to 3rd level.

### The Cult is Denied
Death House tried to kill the party as they run away. 
**Once they go upstairs into the real house**

The fastest path is to come out the trapdoor and then blow through the wall to [[Death House - Area 1 - Entrance]] from [[Death House - Area 3 - Den of Wolves]].

- All the windows are bricked up; the bricked-up win­dows and the outer walls are impervious to the party's weapon attacks and damage-dealing spells.
- All the doors are gone, replaced by slashing scythe­ blades. 
	- DC 15 Acrobatics check to pass through a blade-trapped doorway unscathed. 
	- DC 15 Intelligence check if spend 1 minute studying the blades.
	- DC 15 Dexterity saving throw if pushed into the doorway
	- On failed - 2d10 slashing dmg
- Every room that contains a fireplace, an oven, or a stove is filled with poisonous black smoke.
	- The room is heavily obscured
	- DC 10 Constitu­tion saving throw or take 1d10 poison damage
- Each 5-foot-section of wall has AC 5 and 5 hit points
	- DC 10 Athletics check to blast through a wall. 
	- Each 5-foot section of wall that's destroyed causes a swarm of rats to pour out and at­tack (but they stay in the house)
