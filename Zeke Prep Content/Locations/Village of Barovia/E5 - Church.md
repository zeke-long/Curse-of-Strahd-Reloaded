## What to Read
*Atop a slight rise, against the roots of the pillar stone that supports Castle Raven loft, stands a gray, sagging edifice of stone and wood. This church has obviously weathered the assaults of evil for centuries on end and is worn and weary. A bell tower rises toward the back, and flickering light shines through holes in the shingled roof. The rafters strain feebly against their load. The heavy wooden doors of the church are covered with claw marks and scarred by fire.*

## Encounter / Rooms

### Bring [[Kolyan lndirovich]]'s Body
[[Donavich]] presses the characters into helping him bury the burgomaster in [[E6 - Cemetery]] at dawn.  During the burial, Donavich offers prayers to the [[Morninglord]] in exchange for Kolyan Indirovich's deliverance from Barovia.

Once Kolyan is put in the ground, Donavich suggests that Ireena be taken as far from Castle Ravenloft as possible. He proposes that the characters take her to the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]] in [[Krezk]] or, failing that, the fortified town of [[Vallaki]]. Donavich is unaware that the abbey, once a  bastion of good, has become a den of evil.

### E5a. Hall
*The doors open to reveal a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot long hall leading to a brightly lit chapel. The hall is unlit and reeks of mildew. Four doors, two on each side of the hall, lead to adjacent chambers. You can see that the chapel is strewn with debris, and you hear a soft voice from within reciting a prayer. Suddenly, the prayer is blotted out by an inhuman scream that rises up from beneath the wooden floor.*

### E5b. [[Doru]]'s Bedroom
*This dirty, lightless room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress. Mounted above the bed's headboard is a wooden holy symbol.*
^WhatToReadDoruBedroom
There is nothing of value in this room. 

### E5c. [[Donavich]]'s Bedroom
*This dirty room contains a wooden bed with a straw filled mattress, next to which rests a small table with an oil lamp burning brightly on it. Mounted above the bed's headboard is a wooden sun-shaped holy symbol.*

There is nothing of value in this room

### E5d. Trapdoor
*Time and neglect have punched holes in the ceiling of this moldy room, which contains a few broken roof shingles amid puddles of water. In one corner, set into the floor, is a heavy wooden trapdoor held shut with a chain and a padlock. A young man's screams of anguish can be heard through the door.*
^WhatToReadTrapdoor
If the chain is removed (padlock is broken) and the trapdoor is opened, the screaming in the undercroft stops. Below it is a wooden staircase that descends 15 feet into the Undercroft.

DC 12 Strength check to pull the trapdoor open as the trapdoor is swollen and stuck in the frame. 

### E5d. Office
*An old desk and chair stand against the south wall, a wooden holy symbol mounted above them-a sunburst. A ten-foot-long iron rod attached to the north wall stands bare, suggesting a tapestry once hung there. Against the far wall stands a wooden cabinet with four tall doors.*
^WhatToReadOffice
For its size, the wooden cabinet contains very little.

Inside are a tinderbox, a few wooden boxes full of candles, and two well-used books: [[Hymns to the Dawn]], a volume of chants to the [[Morninglord]], and [[The Blade of Truth: The Uses of Logic in the War Against Diabolist Heresies, as Fought by the Ulmist Inquisition]], a strange book that mixes logic exercises with lurid descriptions of fiend-worshiping cults.

### E5f. Chapel
*The chapel is a shambles, with overturned and broken pews littering the dusty floor. Dozens of candles mounted in candlesticks and candelabras light every dusty corner in a fervent attempt to rid the chapel of shadows. At the far end of the church sits a claw-scarred altar, behind which kneels a priest in soiled vestments. Next to him hangs a long, thick rope that stretches up into the bell tower.*
^WhatToReadChapel
If the players have not gone to the Undercroft add:
*From beneath the chapel floor, you hear a young man's voice cry out, "Father! I'm starving!"*

### E5g. Undercroft
*The church's undercroft has rough-hewn walls and a floor made of damp clay and earth. Rotting wooden pillars strain under the weight of the wooden ceiling. Candlelight from the chapel above slips though the cracks, allowing you to glimpse a gaunt shape in the far corner.*
^WhatToReadUndercroft
[[Doru]] is not brave enough to attack the characters, but pleads for blood. If they get too close he can "smell their blood" and will take a swipe if they are too close. 

If the characters bribe Doru with blood or kill him and revive him he shares: ![[Doru#Knowledge]]
