## What to Read
*A single shaft of light thrusts illumination into the main square, its brightness looking like a solid pillar in the heavy fog. Above the gaping doorway, a sign hangs pre­ cariously askew, proclaiming this to be the Blood on the Vine tavern.*

### Additional Details
The tavern building is about 60 feet square. Close in­ spection of the sign reveals that it originally read "Blood of the Vine." (An "n" has been scratched over with the "f.") This once finely appointed tavern has grown shoddy over the years. A blazing fire in the hearth gives scant warmth to the few huddled souls within. They include [[Arik the Barkeep]], three Vistani Owners (Alenka, Mirabel, Sorvia) sitting together, and a man named [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] - who happens to be the son of the village burgomaster, [[Kolyan lndirovich]].

A small glass of wine costs 1 cp. 
A pitcher of wine costs 1 sp. 

## Encounter
Ismark buys the players drinks
Arik just cleans glasses
Vistani Owners - do not care unless the party is with other Vistani. If they are they suggest the players go to [[Madam Eva]].
