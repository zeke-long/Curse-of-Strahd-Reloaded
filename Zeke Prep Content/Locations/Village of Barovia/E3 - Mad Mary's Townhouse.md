## What to Read

*A moaning sob floats through the still, gray streets, col­oring your thoughts with sadness. The sounds flow from a dark, two-story townhouse.*

### Additional Details
[[Mad Mary]] is there crying, sitting on the floor clutching a malformed doll. 

## Encounter
[[Gertruda]], now a teenager, broke out of the house a week ago and has not been seen since. Her mother fears the worst - and is justified in doing so. See area [[K42]] for more informa­tion on Gertruda's fate.

The malformed doll has a tag from [[Gadof Blinsky]], a toy maker in [[Vallaki]], [[N7]]. 
“Is No Fun, Is No Blinsky!”
