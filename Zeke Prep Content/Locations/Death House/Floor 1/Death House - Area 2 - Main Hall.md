## What to Read
*A wide hall runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end and a sweeping, red marble staircase at the other. Mounted on the wall above the fireplace is a longsword (nonmagical) with a windmill cameo worked into the hilt. The wood-panÂ­eled walls are ornately sculpted with images of vines, flowers, nymphs, and satyrs. 
A cloakroom on the back wall houses several long dark cloaks and a top hat.*
