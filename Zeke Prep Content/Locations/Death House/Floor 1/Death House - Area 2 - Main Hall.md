## What to Read
*A wide hall runs the width of the house, with a black marble fireplace at one end and a sweeping, red marble staircase at the other. Mounted on the wall above the fireplace is a wood-framed portrait of the Durst family: [[Gustav Durst]] and [[Elizabeth Durst]] with their two smiling children, [[Rose]] and [[Thorn]]. Cra­dled in the father's arms is a swaddled baby. Thorn is holding a smiling doll that wears a yellow lace dress. The wood-pan­eled walls are ornately sculpted with images of vines, flowers, nymphs, and satyrs. 
There is a large grandfather clock in the circular space at the back of the stairs. 
A cloakroom on the back wall houses several long dark cloaks and a top hat.*
