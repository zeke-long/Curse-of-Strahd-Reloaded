## What to Read
The kitchen is tidy, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. A stone, dome­ shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door leading to a well­ stocked pantry. 

In the southeast corner of the kitchen is a dumb waiter - a 2-foot-wide stone shaft con­taining a wooden elevator box attached to a simple rope­ and-pulley mechanism that must be operated manually.

### Additional Details
All the food in the pantry ap­pears fresh but tastes bland.
