## What to Read

This dusty chamber is packed with old furniture (chairs, coat racks, standing mirrors, dress mannequins, and the like), all draped in dusty white sheets. Near an iron stove, underneath one of the sheets, you see what looks like a wooden trunk.

### Additional Details
The wooden chest contains the skeletal remains of the family's nursemaid, wrapped in a tattered bedsheet stained with dry blood.

## Encounter
DC 14 Medicine - the nursemaid was stabbed many times and died.

If the characters disturb the remains, the nursemaid's [[Specter]] appears and attacks unless it was previously defeated in [[Death House - Area 15 - Nursemaid's Suite]]. 
**NOTE: This encounter is saved under Area 15**

## Exits
[[Death House - Area 16 - Attic Hall]] - north door
[[Death House - Area 21 - Secret Stairs]] - secret only after characters find the note from Strahd in [[Death House - Area 9 - Secret Room]] or characters find the model house in [[Death House - Area 20 - Children's Room]].
