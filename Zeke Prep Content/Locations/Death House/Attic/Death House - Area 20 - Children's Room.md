## What to Read

This door is initially locked. 

This room contains a bricked-up window flanked by two dusty, wood-framed beds sized for children. Closer to the door is a toy chest with windmills painted on its sides and a dollhouse that's a perfect replica of the dreary ed­ifice in which you stand. These furnishings are draped in cobwebs. Lying in the middle of the floor are two small skeletons wearing tattered but familiar clothing. The smaller of the two cradles a stuffed doll that you also recognize. 

### Additional Details
The Durst children, [[Rose]] and [[Thorn]], were neglected
by their parents and locked in this room until they starved to death. Their small skeletons lie in the middle of the floor, plain as day, wearing tattered clothing that the characters recognize as belonging to the children. Thorn's skeleton cradles the boy's stuffed doll.

## Encounter
DC 5 Intelligence - recognition that the bodies are [[Rose]] and [[Thorn]]
DC 15 Perception on the doll house - find all secret doors (adv. if Rose tells you where to look)

### After Players Touch Dollhouse or Chest
[[Rose]] and [[Thorn]] show up as two [[Ghost]], but:
- small and lawful good
- Have 35 hp
- Lack horrifying visage
- Speak Common
- Challenge rating of 3

They only fight in self-defense, and are kids. 
- If asked how they died, Rose and Thorn explain that their parents locked them in the attic to protect them from "the monster in the basement," and that they died from hunger. 
- If asked how one gets to the basement, Rose points to the dollhouse and says, "There's a secret door in the attic."

### When the Characters Try to Leave the Room
Rose and Thorn try to possess the characters
- A character possessed by Rose gains the following flaw: "I like being in charge and get angry when other people tell me what to do."
- A character possessed by Thorn gains the following flaw: "I'm scared of everything, including my own shadow, and weep with despair when things don't go my way."
A character possessed by the ghost of Rose or Thorn won't willingly leave Death House or the dungeon be­low it. 

### Getting Rid of the Ghosts
DC 11 Intimidation check made as an action - ghost will leave the body of character. 
DC 17 Religion, DC 20 Intelligence check - The only way to put the children's spirits to rest is to put their skeletal remains in their tombs [[Death House - Area 23 - Family Crypt]]. The children don't know this, however. If this is done, everyone gets inspiration. 

## Exits
[[Death House - Area 16 - Attic Hall]] - southern door
