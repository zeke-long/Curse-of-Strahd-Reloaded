## What to Read
The wooden spiral staircase from the attic ends here. A narrow tunnel stretches southward before branching east and west.

## Encounter
From the moment they arrive in the dungeon, the characters can hear an eerie, incessant chant echoing throughout. It's impossible to gauge where the sound is coming from until the characters reach [[Death House - Area 26 - Hidden Spike Pit]] or [[Death House - Area 29 - Ghoulish Encounter]]. They can't discern its words until they reach [[Death House - Area 35 - Reliquary]].

## Exits
[[Death House - Area 23 - Family Crypt]] - East and South
[[Death House - Area 24 - Cult Initiate's Quarters]] - West
