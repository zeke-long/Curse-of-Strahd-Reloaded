## What to Read
This room contains a plain wooden table flanked by long benches. Moldy humanoid bones lie strewn on the dirt floor-the remains of the cult's vile banquets.

In the middle of the south wall is a darkened alcove. 

## Encounter
Characters who approach within 5 feet of the alcove provoke the [[Grick]] that lurks there. Any passive perception under 12 is surprised by the grick. 

## Exits
[[Death House - Area 23 - Family Crypt]] - North Hallway
[[Death House - Area 26 - Hidden Spike Pit]] - West Hallway
[[Death House - Area 29 - Ghoulish Encounter]] - Souther Hallway
