## What to Read
*This room is festooned with moldy skeletons that hang from rusty shackles against the walls. A wide alcove in the south wall contains a painted wooden statue carved in the likeness of a gaunt, pale-faced man wearing a vo­luminous black cloak, his pale left hand resting on the head of a wolf that stands next to him. In his right hand, he holds a smoky-gray crystal orb.
The room has exits in the west and north walls. Chant­ing can be heard coming from the west.*

## Encounter
If the characters touch the statue or orb from Strahd's hand, five [[Shadow]] form around the statue and attack them. The shadows (the spirits of former cultists) pursue those who flee beyond the room's confines.
