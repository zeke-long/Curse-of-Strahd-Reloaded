## What to Read
The staircase ends at a landing with a 6-foot-high ceil­ing of close-fitting planks with a wooden trapdoor set into it. The trapdoor is bolted shut from this side and can be pushed open to reveal the den [[Death House - Area 3 - Den of Wolves]] above.

## Encounter
Once the trapdoor has been found and opened, it re­mains available to characters as a way into and out of the dungeon level.

## Exits
[[Death House - Area 3 - Den of Wolves]] - Up the trapdoor
[[Death House - Area 31 - Dark Lord's Shrine]] - South, down the stairs
