## What to Read

This secret room contains bookshelves packed with tomes describing fiend-summoning rituals and the nec­romantic rituals of a cult called the [[Priests of Osybus]]. 

*A heavy wooden chest with clawed iron feet stands against the south wall, its lid half-closed. Sticking out of the chest is a skeleton in leather armor. Clutched in the skeleton's left hand is a letter bearing the seal of Strahd von Zarovich.*

### Additional Details
Close inspec­tion reveals that the skeleton belongs to a human who triggered a poisoned dart trap. Three darts are stuck in the dead adventurer's armor and ribcage. The dart-firing mechanism inside the chest no longer functions.

Letter from [[Strahd von Zarovich]]:
*My most pathetic servant,
I am not a messiah sent to you by the [[Dark Powers]] of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the ones who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but worms writhing in my earth.
You say that you are cursed, your fortunes spent. You abandoned love for madness, took solace in the bosom of another woman, and sired a stillborn son. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.*

*Your dread lord and master, 
Strahd van Zarovich*
