## What to Read
Unlit oil lamps are mounted on the walls of this elegant hall. Hanging above the mantelpiece is a wood-framed portrait of the Durst family: [[Gustav Durst]] and [[Elizabeth Durst]] with their two smiling children, [[Rose]] and [[Thorn]]. CraÂ­dled in the father's arms is a swaddled baby.
Standing suits of armor flank wooden doors in the east and west walls. Each suit of armor clutches a spear and has a visored helm shaped like a wolf's head. The doors are carved with dancing children. 
The red marble staircase that started on the first floor continues its upward spiral. A cold draft can be felt coming down the steps.

## Encounter
DC 12 Perception - The carved children are not dancing, they are fighting off bats. Elizabeth Durst is looking at the children in the picture with scorn.
