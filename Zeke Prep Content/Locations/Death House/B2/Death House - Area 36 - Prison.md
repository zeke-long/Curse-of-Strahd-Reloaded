## What to Read
The cultists shackled prisoners to the back walls of alcoves here. The prisoners are long gone (their bones litter the floor in [[Death House - Area 27 & 28 - Dining Hall]]), but the rusty shackles remain.

## Encounter
DC 15 Perception - secret door wall on the most eastern wall [[Death House - Area 38 - Ritual Chamber]]

## Loot
Hanging on the back wall of the cell marked X on the map is a human skeleton clad in a tattered black robe. The skeleton belongs to a cult member who questioned the cult's blind devotion to Strahd. Characters who search the skeleton find a gold ring (worth 25 gp) on one of its bony fingers.

## Exits
[[Death House - Area 35 - Reliquary]] - North Hallway
[[Death House - Area 38 - Ritual Chamber]] - Secret Door on the Eastern Wall
