## What to Read
*The chanting stops as you peer into this forty-foot-square room. The smooth masonry walls provide excellent acoustics. Featureless stone pillars support the ceiling, and a breach in the west wall leads to a dark cave heaped with refuse. Murky water covers most of the floor. Stairs lead up to dry stone ledges that hug the walls. In the middle of the room, more stairs rise to form an octago­nal platform that also rises above the water. Rusty chains with shackles dangle from the ceiling directly above a stone altar mounted on the platform. The altar is carved with hid­eous depictions of grasping ghouls and is stained with dry blood.*

### Additional Details
The hole in the west wall leads to a naturally formed alcove which houses [[Lorghoth the Decayer]], a [[Shambling Mound]]. A DC 15 Intelligence check will show that it is a shambling mound. 

The chains dangling from the ceiling are 8 feet long; the cultists would shackle prisoners to the chains, dangle them above the altar, cut them open with knives, and allow the altar to be bathed in blood.

## Encounter

### ONE MUST DIE
- Starts when a character climbs onto the platform

*The chanting rises once more as thirteen dark appari­tions appear on the ledges overlooking the room. Each one resembles a black-robed figure holding a torch, but the torch's fire is black and seems to draw light into it. Where you'd expect to see faces are voids.
"One must die!" they chant, over and over. "One must die! One must die!"*

DC 11 Religion/Insight check to know that to count as a sacrifice, a creature must die on the altar. The apparitions don't care what kind of creature is sacrificed, and they aren't fooled by illusions.

### Do a Sacrifice
The cultists fade away, but their tireless chant of "He is the Ancient. He is the Land," echoes again in the dungeon. [[Strahd von Zarovich]] knows about the sacrifice.

### Don’t do a Sacrifice
*The cultists' chant changes: "Lorghoth the Decayer, we awaken thee!" This chant rouses the sham­bling mound and prompts it to attack.* 

It pursues prey beyond the room but won't leave the dungeon (Characters can run away). It can move through tunnels without squeezing and completely fills its space. At the start of the shambling mound's first turn, the chant changes again: "The end comes! Death, be praised!" 

If the shambling mound dies, the chanting stops and the apparitions vanish forever.
