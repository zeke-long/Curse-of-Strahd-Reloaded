## What to Read
The ghostly chant emanating from [[Death House - Area 38 - Ritual Chamber]] fills this room. Characters can discern a dozen or so voices say­ ing, over and over, "He is the Ancient. He is the Land."

### Additional Details
The cult amassed several "relics" that it used in its rituals. These worthless items are stored in thirteen niches along the walls:
- A small, mummified, yellow hand with sharp claws (a goblin's hand) on a loop of rope
- A knife carved from a human bone
- A dagger with a rat's skull set into the pommel
- An 8-inch-diameter varnished orb made from a nothic's eye
- An aspergillum carved from bone
- A folded cloak made from stitched ghoul skin
- A desiccated frog lashed to a stick (could be mistaken for a wand of polymorph - DC 12 Arcana Check)
- A bag full of bat guano
- A hag's severed finger
- A 6-inch-tall wooden figurine of a mummy, its arms crossed over its chest
- An iron pendant adorned with a devil's face
- The shrunken, shriveled head of a halfling
- A small wooden coffer containing a dire wolf's with­ ered tongue
