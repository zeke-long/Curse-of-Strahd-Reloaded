## What to Read
This tunnel is blocked by a rusty iron portcullis. You can see a wooden wheel half-embedded in the northern wall, but the wheel is beyond the reach of someone east of the portcullis. The floor around the portcullis is submerged under 2 feet of murky water.

## Encounter
DC 20 Strength Check - Forcibly lift the portcullis

## Exits
[[Death House - Area 35 - Reliquary]] - Northern hallway
[[Death House - Area 38 - Ritual Chamber]] - Southern hallway, only once the gate is opened
