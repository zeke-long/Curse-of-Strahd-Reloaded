## What to Read
Dust and cobwebs shroud an elegantly appointed bed­ room and an adjoining nursery. Double doors set with panes of stained glass pull open to reveal a balcony overlooking the front of the house.
The bedroom contains a large bed, two end tables, and an empty wardrobe. Mounted on the wall next to the wardrobe is a full-length mirror with an ornate wooden frame carved to look like ivy and berries.

### Additional Details
The bedroom once belonged to the family's nurse­ maid.  [[Gustav Durst]] and the nursemaid had an affair, which led to the birth of a stillborn baby named Walter. The cult slew the nursemaid shortly thereafter. Unless the characters already defeated it in [[Death House - Area 18 - Storage Room]], the nursemaid's spirit haunts the bedroom as a specter. 

## Encounter
DC 12 Perception: Characters who search the wall for secret doors or otherwise in­spect the mirror can notice eyeballs among the berries.
DC 15 Perception: A secret door is found behind the mirror. It heads up to the attic and [[Death House - Area 16 - Attic Hall]].

**[[Specter]] attack!** The specter manifests and attacks when a character opens the door to the nursery. The specter resembles a terrified, skeletally thin young woman; it can't speak or be reasoned with.

## Exits
[[Death House - Area 11 - Balcony]] - northern door
[[Death House - Area 16 - Attic Hall]] - secret door behind the mirror
