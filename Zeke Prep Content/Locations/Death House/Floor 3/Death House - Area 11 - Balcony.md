## What to Read
You climb the red marble staircase to its full height come to a dusty balcony with a suit of black plate armor standing against one wall, draped in cobwebs. **Surprise!** This suit of animated armor attacks as soon as a character approaches within 5 feet of it.

### Additional Details
