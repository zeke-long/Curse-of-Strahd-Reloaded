## What to Read
This dark room contains a wooden tub with clawed feet, a small iron stove with a kettle resting atop it, and a barÂ­rel under a spigot in the east wall. A cistern on the roof used to collect rainwater, which was borne down a pipe to the spigot; however, the plumbing no longer works.
