## What to Read
*The double doors to this room have dusty panes of stained glass set into them. Designs in the glass resem­ble windmills. The dusty, cobweb-filled master bedroom has burgundy drapes covering the windows. Furnish­ings include a four-poster bed with embroidered cur­tains and tattered gossamer veils, a matching pair of empty wardrobes, a vanity with a wood-framed mirror and jewelry box, and a padded chair. A rotting tiger-skin rug lies on the floor in front of the fire­ place, which has a dust-covered portrait of [[Gustav Durst]] and [[Elizabeth Durst]] hanging above it. A web-filled parlor in the southwest corner contains a table and two chairs. Resting on the dusty tablecloth is an empty porcelain bowl and a matching jug,*
*A door facing the foot of the bed has a full-length mir­ror mounted on it. The door opens to reveal an empty, dust-choked closet. A door in the parlor leads to an outside balcony, facing the rear of the house.*

### Additional Details
A dumbwaiter in the corner of the west wall has a button on the wall next to it. Pressing the button rings the tiny bell in the kitchen.
