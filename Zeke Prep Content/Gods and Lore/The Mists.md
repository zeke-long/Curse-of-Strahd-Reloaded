The Mists can always be found at a domain's borders but can also appear in dense banks that rise wherever adventures demand. Such banks might veil strangers or hidden foes, or they can transport those who enter them to distant lands, other domains, or even beyond the [[Domains of Dread]]. The Mists are inscrutable, but they ever serve the schemes of the [[Dark Powers]], delivering creatures wherever these wicked forces desire.

The [[Dark Powers]] also grant [[Strahd von Zarovich |Darklords]] limited ability to manipulate the Mists surrounding their domains, allowing most to open or close their domains' borders to others on a whim. If a domain's borders are closed, supernatural agitation is obvious to any who approach the Mists. This takes the form of roiling disturbances within the haze, menacing silhouettes, threatening sounds, or other activity themed to the Darklord or domain. Creatures that enter the Mists at this time, including flying creatures, are subject to the following effects:

- A creature that starts its turn in the Mists must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb). This [exhaustion](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb) can't be removed while the creature is in the Mists.
- No matter how far a creature travels in the Mists, or which direction it goes, it gets turned around so that it eventually ends up back in the domain it left.
- The area within the Mists is [[heavily obscured]].

Most Darklords can keep their domains' borders closed indefinitely and can reopen them at will. For some Darklords, slightly varied effects manifest when they close their domains. Others are limited in their ability to affect their borders. For each domain, specifics appear in the "Closing the Borders" portion of the section on that domain's Darklord.
## Wandering the Mists (Borders Open)

If a domain's borders are open, the domain is still not easy to escape from. The area within the Mists remains [[heavily obscured]], but the Mists don't cause creatures to gain levels of [exhaustion](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb). Characters intent on passing through the Mists roll on the Wandering the Mists table to determine what happens.

| 41-65        | Characters emerge from the Mists on stable ground `dice: 1d100` (1d100) feet away from where they entered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 66-75        | Characters emerge on stable ground a mile from where they entered the Mists at midnight of the night after they entered the Mists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 76-85        | Characters emerge from the Mists inside a structure somewhere within the domain they tried to leave, perhaps a cave, crypt, shed, or closet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 86-95        | Other creatures appear within the Mists. Roll any die. If you roll an even number, a lost and terrified [commoner](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#commoner_mm) appears. If you roll an odd number, `dice: 2d6` (2d6) [skeletons](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#skeleton_mm) or 1 [unspeakable horror](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#unspeakable%20horror_vrgr) appears. After the encounter, another `dice: 1d6` (1d6) hours pass, then roll on this table again. |
| 96-99        | Characters emerge from the Mists where they entered to find the domain changed. Perhaps someone the characters knew is gone, and no one has any knowledge of them ever existing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 100          | Characters emerge from the Mists on a world on the Material Plane. After `dice: 1d6` (1d6) hours, the Mists rise around them once more. Roll again on this table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
