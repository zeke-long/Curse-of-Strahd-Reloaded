**Kelemvor** formerly [[Kelemvor Lyonsbane]] also known as the [[Lord of the Dead]] and[[ Judge of the Damned]], was the god of death and the dead, and master of the Crystal Spire in the [Fugue Plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Fugue_Plane "Fugue Plane"). In his mortal days, Kelemvor was a skilled mercenary, with the heart of a noble [[Paladin]], concealed under rude manners and thwarted by his mysterious family curse.

He is the most recent in the chain of God's of the Dead and Justice, but is the first one to really promote death as a part of life. This is the reason why he has a contempt for the [[Undead]]. 

## Appearance

Kelemvor's avatar appeared much as his mortal self, a [human](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Human "Human") warrior with a dark, tanned face, piercing green eyes, a square-jaw, and a black, wild mane with a grey streaks. He was clad in [chainmail](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chainmail "Chainmail") and dark leather, and always wore a wide belt with a large, cabochon-cut [cat's eye](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chrysocolla "Chrysocolla") jewel in the front.
