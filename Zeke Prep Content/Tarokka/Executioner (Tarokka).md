# Strahd's Enemy

*Seek out the brother of the devil's bride. They call him "the lesser," but he has a powerful soul.*

This card refers to [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] (see chapter 3, area E,2). Ismark won't accompany the characters to Castle Ravenloft until he knows that his sister, [[Ireena Kolyana]], is safe.

# Strahd's Location

*I see a dark figure on a balcony, looking down upon this tortured land with a twisted smile.*

Strahd faces the characters at the overlook (area K6).
