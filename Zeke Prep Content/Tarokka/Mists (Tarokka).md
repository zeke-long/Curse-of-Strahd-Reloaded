# Strahd's Enemy

*A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her out at Saint Markovia's abbey, near the mists.*

This card refers to [[Ezmerelda d'Avenir]] (see appendix D). She can be found in the [[Abbey of Saint Markovia]] (see chapter 8, area S19), as well as several other locations throughout Barovia. 

# Strahd's Location

*The cards can't see where the evil lurks. The mists obscure all!*

The card offers no clue about where the final showdown with Strahd will occur. It can happen anywhere you like in Castle Ravenloft. Alternatively, Madam Eva tells the characters to return to her after at least three days, and she will consult the cards again for them, but only to discern the location of their enemy.
