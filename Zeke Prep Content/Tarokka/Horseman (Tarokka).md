# Strahd's Enemy

*A man of death named Arrigal will forsake his dark lord to serve your cause. Beware! He has a rotten soul.*

This card refers to the Vistani assassin [[Arrigal]] (see chapter 5, area N9c). If the characters mention this card reading to him, he accepts his fate and accompanies them. If the characters succeed in defeating Strahd, Arrigal betrays and attacks them, believing that he is destined to become Barovia's new lord.

# Strahd's Location

*He lurks in the one place to which he must return - a place of death.*

Strahd faces the characters in his tomb (area K86).
