# Strahd's Enemy

*I see a man of faith whose sanity hangs by a thread. He has lost someone close to him.*

This card refers to [[Donavich]], the priest in the [[Village of Barovia]] (see chapter 3, area E5 #TODO Barovia Church). He will not accompany the characters until his son, [[Doru]], is dead and buried.

# Strahd's Location
