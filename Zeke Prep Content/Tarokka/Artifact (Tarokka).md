# Strahd's Enemy

*Look for an entertaining man with a monkey. This man is more than he seems.*

This card refers to [[Riciavio]] (see appendix D), who can be found at the[[ Blue Water Inn]] in [[Vallaki]] (chapter 5, area N2). Normally reluctant to accompany the characters, Rictavio changes his tune if the characters tell him about the card reading. He sheds his disguise and introduces himself as Dr. Rudolph van Richten.
The characters might think that [[Gadof Blinsky]], the toymaker of Vallaki (area N7), is the figure they seek, because he has a pet monkey. If they speak to him about this possibility, Blinsky jokes that he and the monkey are "old friends," but if the characters ask him to come with them to fight Strahd, he politely declines. If the characters tell him about the tarokka reading, Blinsky admits that he acquired the monkey from a half-elf carnival ringmaster named Rictavio.

# Strahd's Location

*He lurks in the darkness where the morning light once shone-a sacred place.*

Strahd faces the characters in the chapel (area K15).
