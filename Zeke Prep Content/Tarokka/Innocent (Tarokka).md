# Strahd's Enemy

*Evil's bride is the one you seek!*

This card refers to [[Ireena Kolyana]] (see chapter 3, area E4). Her brother, [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] opposes the idea of lreena's being taken to Castle Ravenloft, but she insists on going there once the characters tell her about the card reading. Ireena won't accompany the characters, however, until [[Kolyart lndirovich]]'s body is laid to rest in the cemetery.

# Strahd's Location

*He dwells with the one whose blood sealed his doom, a brother of light snuffed out too soon.*

Strahd faces the characters in Sergei's tomb (area K85).
