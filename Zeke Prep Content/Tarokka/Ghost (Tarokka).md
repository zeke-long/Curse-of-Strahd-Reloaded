# Strahd's Enemy

*Stir the spirit of the clumsy knight whose crypt lies deep within the castle.*

This card refers to [[Sir Klutz]] the phantom warrior (see chapter 4, area K84, crypt 33). If Sir Klutz is Strahd's enemy, then the phantom warrior disappears not after seven days, but only after he or Strahd is reduced to 0 hit points.

# Strahd's Location

*Look to the father's tomb.*

Strahd faces the characters in the tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia (area K88).
