# Strahd's Enemy

*Look for a dusk elf living among the Vistani. He has suffered a great loss and is haunted by dark dreams. Help him, and he will help you in return.*

This card refers to [[Kasimir Velikov]] (see chapter 5, area N9a). The dusk elf accompanies the characters to Castle Ravenloft only after they lead him to the [[Amber Temple]] and help him find the means to resurrect his dead sister, [[Patrina Velikovna]].

# Strahd's Location

*He waits for you in a place of wisdom, warmth, and despair. Great secrets are there.*

Strahd faces the characters in the study (area K37).
