# Strahd's Enemy

*Find the leader of the feathered ones who live among the vines. Though old, he has one more fight left in him.*

This card refers to [[Davian Martikov]] (see chapter 12, "The Wizard of Wines"). The old were raven, realizing that he has a chance to end Strahd's tyranny, leaves his vineyard and winery in the capable hands of his sons, [[Adrian Martikov]] and [[Elvir Martikov]]. But before he travels to Castle Ravenloft to face Strahd, Davian insists on reconciling with his third son, [[Urwin Martikov]] (see chapter 5, area N2).

# Strahd's Location

*Look to the mother's tomb.*

Strahd faces the characters in the tomb of King Barov and Queen Ravenovia (area K88).
