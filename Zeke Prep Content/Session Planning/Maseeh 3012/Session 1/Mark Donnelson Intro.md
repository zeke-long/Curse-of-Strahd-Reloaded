He preferred to be called [[Darcel von Fangcroix]], a name he believed befitted his dark and brooding persona. His life, blessed with loving and supportive parents, had provided him with every opportunity he could desire. Yet, Darcel's heart held a singular obsessionâ€”to meet his idol, the infamous vampire lord known as Strahd. This enigmatic figure held a mystique that captured Darcel's imagination, turning him into an ardent fanboy of the dark lord.

His journey to Barovia began under a night sky fraught with turmoil and torment. Darcel was camped in his own backyard with a group of friends. Their night of respite turned into a harrowing ordeal when a group of jocks from his town intruded, intent on tormenting him and his companions for their adoration of occult and [[Dark Powers]].

Amid cruel laughter and violence, Darcel's tent was torn down, leaving him exposed to ridicule and abuse. As his friends fled to protect themselves, while the jocks heartlessly pushed Darcel into the dark forest, shouting disdainfully, "Find your way in the night!"

Lost and disoriented, Darcel wandered the forest for what seemed like an eternity, seeking a way out of the suffocating shadows. He found solace beneath the shelter of an ancient tree, where his tears flowed freely. As the tears fell, a strange energy enveloped Darcel. The tree seemed to reach out to him, pulling him into a vortex of mist and shadows. 

As the pale moonlight illuminated his path, Darcel von Fancroix found himself in the very realm he had yearned to explore. He claimed that he had willingly sought out Strahd, driven by his obsessive desire to meet and apprentice under the vampire lord.

Unaware of the intricacies of his arrival, Darcel stepped forward into the heart of Barovia, his gothic fascination and nerdy charm now mingled with a destiny interwoven with the dark figure he idolized.
