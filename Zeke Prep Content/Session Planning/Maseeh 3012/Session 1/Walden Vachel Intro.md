Walden's life had been a tumultuous journey. Long ago, he roamed the lands with his wife, seeking riches and excitement. However, his reckless antics caught the attention of a dangerous group of adversaries—those he had once stolen from in his adventuring days.

Their vengeance was swift and ruthless. They found Walden and his beloved wife, seeking to exact retribution. He attempted to protect her and seek revenge, but he was outmatched and defeated. The loss of his wife left a void in his heart, and he spent the next two decades living a solitary existence, haunted by regrets and grief.

It was during these long years of solitude that a divine presence reached out to Walden. A god saw the potential for redemption in him, offering him a chance to atone for his past misdeeds. Embracing  [[Kelemvor (God)]] , Walden accepted the divine calling, and his life took a new turn as he became a cleric—a champion of righteousness and a seeker of salvation.

Guided by his god's purpose, Walden's newfound mission was clear—to cleanse the world of the undead, those cursed creatures that defied the natural order of life and death. For Walden, it wasn't just about fulfilling his divine duty; it was also a fervent hope that his actions might pave the way for a reunion with his departed wife in the afterlife.

His god, sensing a great evil in the dark realm of Barovia, had sent him on a mission—a mission that would take him to the very heart of the dread land, where a malevolent force held dominion over all. With his clerical powers and a heart burdened by both sorrow and determination, Walden ventured forth into the cursed realm.

As he entered Barovia, he couldn't help but feel the eerie familiarity of the fog-shrouded landscape. Every step he took carried the weight of his past and the promise of redemption. With the memory of his wife driving him forward, [[Walden Vachel]] set out on a quest to vanquish the great undead evil and, in doing so, find solace and peace.
