## [[Session Summary]]: 

Our adventure starts with the six characters coming out of the fogs into the land of Barovia. [[Calliope]] and [[Roland]] introduce themselves to the rest of the party (Roland went to [[Camp Beast-be-Gone]]). [[Mark Donnelson]] is infatuated with Calliope and start to try to spit game. [[Unnamed Tiefling]] is ignoring the rest of the party, while [[Han Velsing]] tried to get everyone else to return from whence they came. [[Walden Vachel]] starts the party down the pathway towards the [[Village of Barovia]].
Our party passes through the [[Gates of Barovia]] without concern, but soon notice that the fog seems so be closing in on them as they walk. After passing through the gates, the gates themselves close off, with the fog right behind it. 
Walden then notices the smell of a dead body holding a note with a large "B" set into its wax seal. Calliope then takes the note and reads [[Kolyan lndirovich's Letter (Version 2)]], which was dated one week ago. 
Calliope, Roland and Walden perform a burial ritual, but it takes longer than they would have liked as the party starts to hear noises and wolf howls from the forest. They quickly get on their way. 
They then meet seven peasants who are headed the opposite direction. Their eyes are glazed over and Walden and Han notice that two of them are slightly more saturated than the rest. None seem happy or excited to be on their way, but they leave the party with the knowledge that "They'll see it", when talking about the devil of the land. 
Finally, the characters enter the [[Village of Barovia]], where they find two children crying in the street. The older child, a girl, asks the party if they can go save their house from a monster. [[Mark Donnelson]] then takes the small rabbit-esque stuffed animal from the boy, causing him to sob. The party also notices that the fog is still approaching from the back but also from the front as they are led to the children's house. 
Calliope stays outside with Darcel and Roland and the children while Walden, Han and UT go into the house. They are greeted with an empty house, two portraits of aristocrats and a coat of arms (golden windmill within a red field) that Han barely recognizes as an incredibly old coat of arms not used anymore.  
Feeling the fog creep even further in is too much for Calliope who starts to feel penned in. She runs out into the fog. She is surrounded by a blinding grey and starts to cough. Cautiously she backs out of the fog, but not before taking one level of exhaustion. She then makes her way into the house alongside Darcel. Roland, not wanting to leave the children in the fog, grabs the by the scruff of the neck and carries them across the threshold of the house. They disappear into mist, and our party is now waiting in the foyer of an empty house, trapped by the fog that has fully surrounded them.
