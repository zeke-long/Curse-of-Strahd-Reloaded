As a child, the bugbear [[Roland]] had been found abandoned at the outskirts of a conservative human village. A barren couple had taken him in as their own, giving him a life filled with love, yet marred by the burden of being different. Growing up, he witnessed the unspoken expectations of the villagers, who believed he must strive to live up to their standards, despite his monstrous heritage.
But it wasn't until recently that his world was upended entirely. His adoptive parents, swayed by the teachings of a zealous preacher, decided that the "monstrous" nature of their child was against the tenets of their faith. In a heart-wrenching decision, they sent him away to a distant camp, a place where they believed he could be "cured" of his bugbear blood.
Struggling with feelings of shame and inadequacy, Roland underwent the camp's rigorous rituals, hoping to change what he never asked to be. But destiny had other plans for him. In a flash of blinding light, he found himself torn from his reality and thrust into the nightmarish realm of Barovia, trapped and isolated.
As he emerged from the fog, uncertainty filled his heart. What cruel fate had befallen him? The fog obscured his surroundings, and the chill in the air seemed to seep into his bones. He knew not how or why he was in this dreadful place, but one thing was clear: the darkness would not consume him.
Taking a deep breath, Roland squared his shoulders and clenched his fists, finding strength in the memories of his adoptive parents' love and the warmth of their hearth. He may have felt the weight of shame and the burden of expectations back in his village, but here, in this land of shadows, he would rise above it all.
With resolute determination, Rolands ventured forth, seeking answers and a way to break free from this curse. The light of his kind heart would shine through the darkness, and he would prove that his bugbear heritage did not define him. In the heart of Barovia, he would forge a new identity and perhaps discover a greater purpose that lay ahead.
