## Recap 

![[Session 6#^summary]]
## Strong start 
> Chanting still echoes throughout the halls. The party has just slain two ghasts, with the help of Thorn inhabiting Calliope's body, whom you think are the lord and lady of the house and leaders of the ineffectual cult. 
> One would think that having killed the leaders of the cult, the chanting would have died down and you would be able to take a breath, but there appears to be more mysteries to uncover in Durst Manor.
