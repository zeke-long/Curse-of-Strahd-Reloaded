## [[Session Summary]]: 

They got to the attic of the house - they killed the nursemaid
They found a hidden room with a letter from Strahd that was kind of putting people on blast. 
Han Velsing also sat in the chair of the lord and then found a key in the desk. 
The party also saw a portrait of the family and Calliope noticed that the woman in the portrait did not seem happy. The man was holding a baby in a bundle - and the letter alluded to a stillborn child with a mistress. 
Near the end of the session a broom tried to fight Han Velsing and he broke the broom. 
Walden suffered injury from a specter that lowered his max HP to 3.
